Assignment 1

Write a C program that outputs your name and McGill Student ID in the following
format:
My name is Nathan Friedman (horizontally) and my McGill ID (diagonally) is:
2
  6
    0
      6
        6
          1
            6
              1
                3
(Of course, you are to use your own name and ID.)
This assignment may seem overly simple to many of you but it is intended to introduce
you to the environment needed to develop and run a C program. To do this assignment
you do not need any material we have not covered yet (such as loops, if-statements, etc.)
